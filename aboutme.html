        <p>My body of work uses a combination of multimedia digital artforms in as many mediums as I can in order to explore themes of the surreal and grotesque found within the subconscious. I have experienced frequent nightmares since my childhood and have grown an obsession over the messages and feelings they show to me. Because of this, I have felt this insatiable itch to share these uncomfortable experiences with others. I enjoy using a combination of video art, 3D modeling and animation, creative coding, and audio design in my work as I reach to express these experiences as best as I can and allow you, the viewer, to share an interest with me.
